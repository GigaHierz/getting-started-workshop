## 1. How to check your solution.

- Documentation for Java Script : [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

To check your code you have to compile your JS file.
To do that, you have to run the following command:

```
node name-of-file.js
```

- make sure you are in the right directory in your terminal. You might have to add the directory the file is in...

  - e.g. when your terminal shows you that you are at the `getting-started-workshop`

  you have to run this command:

  ```
  node java-script/your-name.js
  ```

  or you navigate into the directory with

  ```
  cd java-script
  ```

  and here you can run this command

  ```
  node your-name.js
  ```
